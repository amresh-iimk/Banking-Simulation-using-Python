#Project Name : Banking Portfolio Simulation
#Sub-Project Name : Application Data Creation
#Description - This piece of code creates the dummy application data.
#
# Overall flow of the project:
#       1. Application data creation **
#       2. Simulating bureau pull and data creation
#       3. Applying a dummy scoring model (will replace later with a trained model) and policy parameters for decisioning
#       4. Approved and Disbursed applications will be onboarded on to the portfolio
#       5. Using probability and general portfolio characteristics, month on month performance of loans will be simulated
#       6. Now that the initial version of portfolio is ready, we can use this data for analytics and reporting
#       7. Fine tune the portfolio data for business seasonality and know cyclicity
#
#Other points TBD
